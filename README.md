In an era defined by escalating environmental challenges, climate change looms as one of the most pressing global threats. To combat this crisis and foster a collective drive towards a sustainable future, the Ecothon challenges participants to conceive, design, and construct a transformative mobile application.

Maybe the reason that climate change is not well known is because of the lack of knowledge about the global crisis. To resolve this we created an app.
The world is at a pivotal crossroads, teetering on the precipice of irreversible climate change. In the face of this crisis, the Ecothon beckons innovative minds to create a groundbreaking mobile application that transcends the ordinary. This visionary platform aims to serve as an agent of change, enlightening users about the profound implications of climate change, while simultaneously empowering them to become stewards of our planet through informed action.
